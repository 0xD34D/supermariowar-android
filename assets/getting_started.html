	<p>
	Super Mario War is a game for up to four players with many different modes of play.  The basic
	goal of the game is to be the last player standing, and to accomplish this goal you must jump
	on your opponents' heads to kill them.  There are many Mario-themed items you can use to help
	you kill your opponents, as well.  In addition, there are several variations on this basic
	gameplay mechanic which you can try, such as Chicken, Capture The Flag, and so on.  Plus, for
	those who enjoy customization, there are several aspects of the game which you can tweak to
	your liking through the Options menus, and if you like, you can make your own maps, skins, and
	other custom content to use (or download others' to use), too!
	</p>

	<p>
	This section of the manual explains how to navigate the game's menus, and contains a short
	explanation of Tournaments and Tours as well.
	</p>

	<h2>The Main Menu</h2>
	<p><img src="docs/ss02.png"></p>

	<p>
	From this menu, you can access everything else in the game.
	<li><b>Start</b> will take you to the Team and Character Selection screen (see below).
	<li><b>Players</b> allows you to change players between Player (human), Bot (computer), and
	None.  You can't have less than two players active at any one time.
	<li><b>Match</b> allows you to select Single Game, Tournament 2 through 10, or any Tours you
	have on your machine.  See Tournaments and Tours, below.
	<li><b>Options</b> takes you to the Options menu.  For more information, check its section
	towards the end of this manual.
	<li><b>Controls</b> lets you configure the players' control schemes to your liking.  For more
	info, check the Controls section of this manual.
	<li><b>Exit</b> causes the game to exit.
	</p>

	<h2>Team and Character Selection</h2>
	<p><img src="docs/ss03.png"></p>
	<p><img src="docs/ss04.png"></p>

	<p>
	From this screen, you can configure who is using which character and is on which team.
	<li>You can select what character you'd like to be, out of all the skins you have on your
	machine, with Up and Down.
	<li>You can select what team you want to be on with Left and Right.
	<li>If you want to have the game select a skin for you at random, press Up and Down together
	(or if using a joystick, press the Random button).
	<li>Press the "Enter" button to lock in your selection, then again to go to the Game Selection screen.
	</p>

	<h2>Game Selection</h2>
	<p><img src="docs/ss05.png"></p>
	<p>
	From this menu, you can select your game mode, select the map you wish to use, change various
	mode settings, and tag your maps for easy selection.  (When playing a Tour, all options on
	this screen, besides Start, are disabled.)
	<li><b>Start</b> starts the game.
	<li><b>Mode</b> allows you to change game modes.  For info on these, please refer to the Game
	Modes section of this manual.
	<li><b>Lives/Kills/Time/Etc.</b> allows you to change the current game mode's basic parameter
	(i.e. the game length).
	<li><b>Map</b> allows you to change the map you want to use.  You can press Left or Right to
	pick another map.
	<li><b>Filters</b> allows you to select maps that only meet certain criteria.  You can select
	one or more categories (such as whether or not the map contains moving platforms) and the
	game will only give you maps that meet all the criteria established.  The bottom category,
	Simple, can be used as a custom filter by selecting the green question mark icon, which will
	give you a thumbnail view (see below) of all the maps.  From there, maps can be toggled on
	(signified by a little coin) and off.
	<li><b>Thumbs</b> allows you to view many maps at once with a "thumbnail"-style view.  To
	view other pages, scroll up or down off the screen.
	</p>

	<h2>Playing the Game</h2>
	<p><img src="docs/ss06.png"></p>

	<p>
	The main goal of the game is to stomp on your opponents' heads to kill them, although depending
	on the map you're playing on, you may be able to kill them in other ways, such as with items.
	There may also be additional rules or a different way of winning, depending on the mode you are
	playing; for information on these, you can check the Game Modes section of this manual.  For
	information on the controls you'll be using to play the game, check out the section on Controls,
	below.  And to learn about the different items and map elements you can use to turn the tables on
	your opponents, take a look at the Items and Special Blocks sections, towards the middle of the
	manual.
	</p>

	<h2>Tournaments and Tours</h2>
	<p><img src="docs/ss07.png"> <img src="docs/ss08.png"></p>

	<p>
	In a Tournament, players play games until one player has amassed a certain number of wins.
	The number of the Tournament determines how many wins are required (so, if you pick Tournament
	4, you have to win four times).  Each time a player wins, they will receive an icon on the
	scoreboard (first picture, above).  This icon will be representative of the mode played.
	</p>

	<p>
	In a Tour, players play a series of predetermined games ("tour stops").  At the end of each
	game, players receive points based on how well they placed, and icons will be displayed on
	the scoreboard (second picture, above) to show just how each player placed in that round.
	Tours can be created by making a text file in the game's Tours subdirectory, following the
	correct format (check out simple.txt for more info).  It is possible to designate how valuable
	each individual tour stop is (this information is displayed along the top of the scoreboard -
	see the screenshot), as well as which tour stops grant a bonus item to the winner.
	</p>

	<p>
	At the end of a Tournament, or after every game within the Tournament if that option is set
	(see the Options section towards the end of this manual), the winner will get a chance to
	spin the bonus wheel to acquire an item that they can use in the next game or games.  However,
	in Tours, the bonus wheel will only appear in places where the tour's creator designates it,
	regardless of any current settings.  Tour stops with this opportunity are represented on the
	scoreboard as small winged yellow boxes.
