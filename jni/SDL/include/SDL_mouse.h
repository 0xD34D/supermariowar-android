/**
 *  \file SDL_mouse.h
 *  
 *  Include file for SDL mouse event handling.
 *
 *  Please note that this ONLY discusses "mice" with the notion of the
 *  desktop GUI. You (usually) have one system cursor, and the OS hides
 *  the hardware details from you. If you plug in 10 mice, all ten move that
 *  one cursor. For many applications and games, this is perfect, and this
 *  API has served hundreds of SDL programs well since its birth.
 *
 *  It's not the whole picture, though. If you want more lowlevel control,
 *  SDL offers a different API, that gives you visibility into each input
 *  device, multi-touch interfaces, etc.
 *
 *  Those two APIs are incompatible, and you usually should not use both
 *  at the same time. But for legacy purposes, this API refers to a "mouse"
 *  when it actually means the system pointer and not a physical mouse.
 *
 *  The other API is in SDL_input.h
